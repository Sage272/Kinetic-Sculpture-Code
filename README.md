# Kinetic-Sculpture-Code
My Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy (DPEA) Kinetic Sculpture Code

I was provided with the base code by the DPEA, but I was given with only the initial functions of loop and setup, as well as some global variables, in "FinalKineticSculptureCodeTest.ino", with the rest of the code being mine.

The other libraries are the DPEA's, and I did not add any code to them.
